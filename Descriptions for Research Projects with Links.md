Examples of my (Jerome Pullen Jr.'s) previous research:

<b>“Freecycle Research Overview and Discussion.pdf”</b>: https://github.com/Jeromepullen/Research-Projects/blob/master/Freecycle%20Research%20Overview%20and%20Discussion.pdf 
is the part of the research paper I wrote for Dr. Michael Krush of the North Dakota State University Marketing Department when we researched the motivations behind the use of The Freecycle Network (an online grassroots / nonprofit movement of people who are giving (and receiving) items for free from within their community).  For that paper I analyzed data collected from 45 in-depth interviews of Freecycle Network users.

are from studies that I conducted while working with Dr. Greiner (Charles River Eye Associates / Harvard Medical School).  I was researching whether or not patients experienced better outcomes from treating their dry eye syndrome with Lid Expression procedures or Lipiflow procedures.  The "Lipiflow vs Lid Expression Data with Stats.xlsx” file is a collection of all the measurements that were taken at the beginning of treatment (baseline) and after 3 months of treatment.  The “Summary of Lipiflow vs Lid Expression Data.xlsx” file is a summary of all those measurements.

<b>“Meibomian Gland Analysis Procedure.pdf”</b>: https://github.com/Jeromepullen/Research-Projects/blob/master/Ophthalmology%20Procedure%20Document%20-%20Meibomian%20Gland%20Analysis.pdf

& <b>“Lid Expression Procedure.pdf”</b>: https://github.com/Jeromepullen/Research-Projects/blob/master/Ophthalmology%20Procedure%20Document%20-%20Lid%20Expression.pdf

files are documents that I developed in order for Dr. Greiner to record information from procedures that he routinely performed.  I created those based on criteria of what information he needed to record and in the order of which he carried out each procedure.

<b>“Spotify User Research Project.pdf”</b>: https://github.com/Jeromepullen/Research-Projects/blob/master/Spotify%20User%20Research%20Project.pdf
is a project I created using data from Reddit to find the most critical issues that users had been experiencing while using Spotify.
